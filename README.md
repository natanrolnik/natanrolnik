I'm Natan.

I've learned how to program in the AppStore's 2nd year, in Objective-C and iPhoneOS 3.

Nowadays, I do iOS - mostly infra and iPad - at [Monday.com](https://monday.com), and I'm interested in [Server Side Swift](https://www.raywenderlich.com/u/natanrolnik), Xcode project generation with [Tuist](https://tuist.io), amongst other things.

You can read [my blog](https://blog.natanrolnik.me) to find out some interesting thoughts or articles.
